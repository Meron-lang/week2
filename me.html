           <h1>  Global Team</h1>
           We are a group of volunteers located in the United States—many of us ourselves <br>
            former refugees—who are committed to improving the lives of immigrants through <br>
            education and vocational programs. We hope that the training opportunities <br>
            that we provide will enable immigrants to obtain better employment <br>
            and provide better lives for themselves and their families in their <br>
             future adopted countries.
           </p>  
           <p>All staff members are located in Sudan, and all are themselves refugees. <br>
               They bring the expertise that they developed in prior work experience in Eritrea,<br>
                and we equip them with the materials to be effective in teaching and <br>
                their other roles in supporting our students.
