    <p>KABBEE is a non-profit organization that started out of a desire to aid refugees <br>
        as they strive to transition to new lives in their adopted countries. <br>
         We believe in the motto that a little help goes a long way and that <br>
         we can make a difference in the lives of refugee communities by providing education,<br> 
         technical and vocational trainings. Our vision is that we can transform <br>
         many refugees especially youth, <br> 
        to become independent and future productive citizens in their adopted countries.</p>
